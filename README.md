# RTOS

Developed a real-time operating system (RTOS)-based safety system to prevent train accidents. Utilized sensors to detect track anomalies and obstructions, enabling automatic brake control and alert mechanisms. The system was built for high reliability, real-time responsiveness, and aimed at enhancing railway safety and automation. In order to assure effective and immediate reaction to air quality risks, this project investigates the design and implementation of an advanced air monitoring and purification system for automotive industry that makes use of a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). The system uses a variety of sensors to identify toxic gasses, pollutants, and humidity levels. When critical thresholds are surpassed, the system immediately starts the purifying process. Since ensuring safe air quality inside a car is so critical, the RTOS makes sure that air purification is handled as a top priority. The design of the system, the significance of real-time operations, and its possible effects on vehicle safety and occupant health are highlighted in this project. Several key components contribute to the suggested air monitoring and purification system: air purification devices, temperature and humidity sensors (DHT11), gas sensors (MQ-2 and MQ-6), and an RTOS for task scheduling and execution. The sensors provide data to the RTOS-managed central processing unit while continually scanning the air for contaminants. The air purification devices are activated by the RTOS in order of priority when pollution levels above certain criteria.
